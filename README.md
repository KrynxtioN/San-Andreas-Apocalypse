### 🗺️ Explore the World

San Andreas is divided into 24 zones, some requiring the Survivor Pass to enter. Each zone features radio towers that, once unlocked, reveal map blips, the minimap, and zombie proximity. Wildlife roams freely, allowing hunting for meat, fur, and other resources. NPCs populate the world, offering quests, tips, and valuable items, while interactive characters can increase friendship levels through gifts and help. Shelters and safe zones provide security, and shops scattered across the map sell weapons, vehicles, seeds, clothing, and more.
